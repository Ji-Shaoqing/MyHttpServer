This project uses CMake to build it up, and I have given the CmakeLists.txt. You can pull it to your local computer, and try to build it up.

Just make a new directory(you can name it as build/) under project root directory(MyHttpServer/), then change into it, use cmake .. command to create it and use make command to construct the project into a executable program, you can execute it finally.

This project uses local computer's 8080 port to realise a simple http server. It is very rudimentary, if you have any ideas, just do and improve it. Let's make it better! (Make some inserts to verify whether my ssh-signature is ready.)
